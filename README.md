## Glasgow Index Components

The tool analyzes 9 key components of flow limitations:

1. **Skew**: Asymmetrical inspiration flow patterns
2. **Spike**: Unexpectedly narrow, tall inspirations
3. **Flat Top**: Plateau-shaped inspiration peaks
4. **Top Heavy**: Inspirations spending too much time at high flow rates
5. **Multi Peak**: Multiple peaks within single inspirations
6. **No Pause**: Missing pause between expiration and next inspiration
7. **Inspir Rate**: Elevated inspiration rate (>20/min)
8. **Multi Breath**: Multiple inspirations per expiration
9. **Variable Amp**: Inconsistent inspiration amplitude

## Installation & Setup

### Web Interface

1. Place all files in the same directory:
   - `multi_night_analyzer.html`
   - `EDFFile.js`
   - `FlowLimits.js`
   - `DateRangeFilter.js`

2. Open `multi_night_analyzer.html` in a modern web browser

3. Select your ResMed SD card folder or individual BRP files. The app scans the filenames and shows the available sleep-night span without reading the large BRP contents.

4. Choose **All available nights**, **Last 30 days**, **Last 90 days**, or **Custom date range**, then click **Analyze**.

5. **For complete analysis**: Upload your entire ResMed SD card folder (recommended)
   - **Includes**: Machine type, IPAP, EPAP, pressure support, PAP mode extraction
   - **Files analyzed**: DATALOG/*.edf, STR.edf, Identification.tgt, SETTINGS/*
   
   **Alternative**: Upload individual BRP.edf files (Glasgow Index only)

### Desktop Application

1. Install Python 3.7 or higher

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python glasgow_analyzer.py
   ```

## Usage

### Data Requirements

#### Complete Analysis (Recommended)
Upload your entire ResMed SD card for comprehensive analysis including:

**Files Analyzed:**
- `DATALOG/*/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_BRP.edf` - Breathing/flow data (for Glasgow Index)
- `STR.edf` - Summary/settings data (for pressure settings and PAP mode)  
- `Identification.tgt` - Machine identification (for machine type)
- `SETTINGS/*.tgt` - Configuration files (future expansion)

**Data Extracted:**
- Glasgow Index components (9 breathing quality metrics)
- Machine Type (e.g., "AirCurve 10 VAuto", "AirSense 10 AutoSet")
- IPAP pressure values (inspiratory pressure)
- EPAP pressure values (expiratory pressure)  
- Pressure Support (IPAP - EPAP)
- PAP Mode (CPAP, APAP, BiPAP, etc.)

#### Glasgow Index Only
Alternatively, upload individual files with the naming convention:
- `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_BRP.edf` (breathing/flow data files only)

These files are typically found on your ResMed SD card in:
- `DATALOG/YYYY/MMDD/` folders

Or in OSCAR backup directories:
- `Profiles/[Profile]/ResMed_[Serial]/Backup/DATALOG/YYYY/`

### Web Interface Usage

1. **File Selection**:
   - **Recommended**: Click **Choose SD card** and select the card's root folder for complete analysis
   - **Alternative**: Click **Choose BRP files** for Glasgow Index analysis only
   - You can also drag and drop an SD card folder or individual files
   - The tool detects the available sleep nights before analysis starts

2. **Processing**:
   - Choose **All available nights**, **Last 30 days**, **Last 90 days**, or **Custom date range** after selecting data
   - The Analyze button shows how many nights will be processed
   - Date-range selection happens before BRP file contents are read, so out-of-range breathing files do not consume analysis time
   - Machine identification and pressure settings are extracted first
   - Progress is shown with a progress bar and status updates

3. **Results**:
   - Summary cards show key statistics including machine type
   - Interactive trend charts display Glasgow Index over time  
   - Component analysis charts for detailed breathing pattern analysis

## Understanding Results

### Glasgow Index Interpretation

- **0.0 - 0.2**: Excellent breathing quality
- **0.2 - 1.0**: Good breathing quality  
- **1.0 - 2.0**: Fair breathing quality (minor flow limitations)
- **2.0 - 3.0**: Poor breathing quality (significant flow limitations)
- **3.0+**: Very poor breathing quality (severe flow limitations)

### Night Grouping Logic

The tool intelligently groups sessions into sleep nights based on start time:

- **Evening sessions (6:00 PM - 11:59 PM)**: Belong to the current calendar date's sleep night
- **Morning sessions (12:00 AM - 11:59 AM)**: Belong to the **previous** calendar date's sleep night  
- **Afternoon sessions (12:00 PM - 5:59 PM)**: Belong to the current calendar date (unusual timing)

**Example**: 
- Session starting 10:30 PM on Aug 19 → "Aug 19 night"
- Session starting 2:15 AM on Aug 20 → "Aug 19 night" (same sleep period)
- Session starting 6:45 AM on Aug 20 → "Aug 19 night" (same sleep period)

This ensures that sleep sessions crossing midnight are properly grouped as a single night.

### Weighted Averages

When multiple sessions exist for a single sleep night, the tool calculates duration-weighted averages:

```
Weighted GI = Σ(Session_GI × Session_Duration) / Total_Duration
```

This ensures longer sessions have appropriate influence on the nightly average.

### Trend Analysis

Use the trend charts to identify:
- **Overall improvement/deterioration** in breathing quality
- **Seasonal patterns** or therapy adjustments
- **Component-specific issues** that may need attention
- **Correlation with therapy changes** (pressure, EPR, etc.)

## Therapy Optimization

The tool now provides comprehensive pressure data analysis to help optimize your therapy:

### Pressure Support Analysis
- **Automatic calculation**: IPAP - EPAP for each night
- **Track pressure support trends** alongside Glasgow Index changes
- **Correlate pressure support levels** with specific GI components
- Compare nights with different pressure support settings to find optimal levels

### IPAP/EPAP Analysis  
- **Track individual pressure trends** over time
- **Identify optimal pressure ranges** for your breathing patterns
- **Correlate pressure changes** with Glasgow Index improvements
- **Balance OSA control** (AHI) with flow limitation reduction (GI)

### PAP Mode Analysis
- **Automatic detection** of CPAP, APAP, BiPAP, ASV modes
- **Compare effectiveness** between different PAP modes
- **Track mode changes** and their impact on breathing quality

### Machine Type Tracking
- **Automatic identification** of your PAP device model
- **Consistent data tracking** across machine upgrades or changes
- **Export compatibility** for sharing with healthcare providers

## Technical Notes

### File Processing
- Each EDF file is parsed using the European Data Format specification
- Flow data is extracted and converted to L/min
- Sampling rate is typically 25 Hz (40ms per sample)

### Algorithm Implementation
- Based on the original Glasgow Index algorithm by DaveSkvn
- Implements all 9 component calculations with original thresholds
- Maintains compatibility with single-file analysis tools

### Performance
- Web interface: Suitable for 10-50 files
- Desktop application: Can handle hundreds of files efficiently
- Processing time: ~1-5 seconds per file depending on duration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No flow data found"**: 
   - Ensure you're using BRP.edf files (not PLD or SAD files)
   - Check file isn't corrupted

2. **"Incorrect file format"**:
   - Verify files are genuine ResMed EDF format
   - Some third-party tools may create incompatible files

3. **Missing data points**:
   - Very short sessions (<5 minutes) may not provide reliable results
   - Ensure files contain actual sleep data, not just brief machine tests

### Browser Compatibility (Web Interface)
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support  
- Safari: Full support
